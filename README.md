## Game Rules

The PIG Game is a simple dice game with the following rules:

1. Two players take turns to roll a six-sided die.
2. A player can roll the die as many times as they want in their turn.
3. The value rolled on the die is added to the player's current score.
4. If a player rolls a 1, they lose all their current score for that turn, and it becomes the next player's turn.
5. The player can choose to "Hold," which adds their current score to their total score and ends their turn.
6. The first player to reach a total score of 100 or more wins the game.
